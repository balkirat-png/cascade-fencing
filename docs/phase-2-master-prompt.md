# Phase 2: Build Remaining Pages - Master Prompt

## Overview

The homepage is complete and looks excellent. Now build the remaining core pages of the website. Reference the SEO structure document (cascade-fencing-seo-structure.md) for proper keywords and content optimization for each page.

---

## Navigation Updates First

Before building new pages, update the existing navigation:

**Services Dropdown - Remove "Specialty Fencing":**
The Services dropdown should only have two options:
- Wood Fence Installation
- Wood Fence Repair

Remove the "Specialty Fencing" option entirely from the dropdown menu.

**Service Areas Link:**
Make the "Service Areas" navigation link scroll smoothly to the "Serving Sumner and Surrounding Communities" section on the homepage (use scroll behavior with offset for the sticky header). All city name links in that section should be clickable and navigate to their respective city pages once those are built in Phase 4.

---

## Pages to Build (In Priority Order)

## Design Consistency Across All Pages

All new pages should maintain the exact same design language as your homepage:

**Color Scheme:**
Use your brand colors consistently - primary green (#35513B) for headers, buttons, and accents, gold (#A18956) for icons and highlights, and clean whites/grays for backgrounds and text.

**Typography:**
Young Serif for all headings (H1, H2, H3), Poppins for body text and UI elements. Maintain the same font sizes and hierarchy as the homepage.

**Buttons:**
All buttons should match your homepage style - rounded corners, proper padding, shadows, hover effects with slight scale, and your brand colors.

**Section Spacing:**
Use consistent vertical padding between sections (80-100px) and horizontal padding/max-width containers to match homepage layout.

**Images:**
Use Next.js Image component with lazy loading and blur placeholders. Pull from your actual gallery photos wherever possible. All images need descriptive alt text for accessibility and SEO.

**Animations:**
Apply the same Framer Motion animations - sections fade in on scroll, cards lift on hover, buttons scale on hover. Keep animations subtle and professional.

**Header & Footer:**
Use the exact same header and footer components on every page. Navigation should highlight the current page.

**CTAs:**
Every page should have clear conversion points with your two standard CTAs (Get Free Estimate button and Call phone number).

---

## Internal Linking Strategy

As you build these pages, implement strategic internal linking:

**From Wood Fence Installation page:**
Link to Gallery, specific fence type sections on the same page, city pages (once built), and back to homepage.

**From Wood Fence Repair page:**
Link to Gallery (especially if you have repair before/afters), Installation page (for cases where replacement makes more sense), and city pages.

**From Gallery:**
Link back to Installation page with CTAs like "Ready to start your project?", link to Repair page for repair-focused images, link to specific service pages based on image categories.

**From About page:**
Link to Installation and Repair service pages, Gallery to showcase work, Contact page for getting started.

**From Contact page:**
Link to service pages so people can learn more before requesting estimate.

**Update Homepage:**
Now that you're building these pages, make sure all navigation links and buttons on the homepage actually work and go to the correct pages.

---

## Testing After Building Each Page

After you complete each page:
- Verify all navigation links work correctly
- Test responsive design on mobile, tablet, desktop
- Check that images load properly
- Verify form validation (on Contact page)
- Test all CTAs and internal links
- Ensure animations trigger smoothly
- Check that the design matches homepage quality
- Verify SEO metadata is properly set

---

## Technical Notes

**Routing:**
Use Next.js App Router structure:
- `/app/services/wood-fence-installation/page.tsx`
- `/app/services/wood-fence-repair/page.tsx`
- `/app/gallery/page.tsx`
- `/app/about/page.tsx`
- `/app/contact/page.tsx`

**Image Organization:**
All images should be pulled from `/images/gallery/photo/` - you have 30+ production-ready photos covering all fence types mentioned.

**Form Handling:**
The contact form on the Contact page should use the same logic as your homepage modal form - React Hook Form + Zod validation, console.log for now (will connect to form service later).

**Mobile Experience:**
Every page must be fully responsive and look great on mobile. Test hamburger menu navigation between pages, ensure touch targets are large enough, and verify images scale properly.

---

## Build Order

Build pages in this exact order:
1. Wood Fence Installation (highest priority conversion page)
2. Wood Fence Repair (second conversion page)
3. Gallery (supports both service pages)
4. About (builds trust)
5. Contact (alternative to modal form)

After these are complete and tested, we'll move to Phase 3 for city pages and final optimizations.
